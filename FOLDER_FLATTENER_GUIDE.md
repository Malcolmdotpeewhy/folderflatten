### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Download Folder Organization
```
Downloads/
├── Project_A/
│   ├── doc1.pdf
│   └── SubFolder/
│       └── image1.jpg
├── Project_B/
│   └── spreadsheet.xlsx
└── existing_file.txt

After flattening:
Downloads/
├── doc1.pdf
├── image1.jpg
├── spreadsheet.xlsx
└── existing_file.txt
```

#### Scenario 2: Media Collection Flattening
```
Photos/
├── 2023/
│   ├── January/
│   │   └── vacation1.jpg
│   └── February/
│       └── birthday.jpg
└── 2024/
    └── March/
        └── concert.jpg

After flattening:
Photos/
├── vacation1.jpg
├── birthday.jpg
└── concert.jpg
```

## Duplicate Handling Options

### Rename Mode (Recommended)
- Original: `document.pdf`
- Duplicate: `document_1.pdf`
- Another: `document_2.pdf`

### Overwrite Mode
- Replaces existing files with files from subfolders
- **Warning**: This will permanently delete the original files

### Skip Mode
- Keeps original files unchanged
- Skips any files with the same name from subfolders

## Archive Handling Options

### Extract Archives
- Pulls files out of `.zip` archives found in subfolders
- Extracted files are flattened into the root directory

### Archive Originals
- Moves original `.zip` files to an archive folder (defaults to `_archives`)
- Keeps the root tidy after extraction

## Filters & Safety Options

### Skip Symlinks
- Ignores symbolic links to avoid moving linked targets by accident

### Extension Filters
- **Include**: Only move files with listed extensions
- **Exclude**: Skip files with listed extensions

### Pattern Filters
- Skip files matching glob patterns (e.g., `*.tmp`, `cache/*`)

### Directory Filters
- Skip folders matching glob patterns (e.g., `node_modules`, `**/cache`)
- Limit scanning to a maximum depth for large trees

### Size Limits
- Set minimum or maximum file sizes to include

### Reports
- Use “Copy Summary” to place key stats on the clipboard
- Use “Export Report” to save a JSON summary

## Safety Features

### Error Handling
- **File Lock Protection**: Handles files in use by other applications

- Threaded processing to keep UI responsive
- Automatic cleanup of temporary data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Drag & Drop Not Working
- **Cause**: tkinterdnd2 not installed
- **Solution**: Run `pip install tkinterdnd2` or use Browse button
- **Alternative**: Use the "Browse Folder" button instead

#### Permission Errors
- **Cause**: Insufficient file system permissions
- **Solution**: Run as administrator or check folder permissions
- **Prevention**: Ensure you have write access to the target folder

#### Files Not Moving
- **Cause**: Files may be in use by other applications
- **Solution**: Close applications using the files and retry
- **Check**: Look at the error log for specific file details

#### Application Won't Start
- **Cause**: Python not installed or not in PATH
- **Solution**: Install Python 3.7+ and ensure it's in your system PATH
- **Test**: Run `python --version` in command prompt

### Log File Analysis
Check `folder_flattener.log` for detailed information:
- File operations and their results
- Error messages with specific file paths
- Timing information for performance analysis
- Statistics for each operation session

## Best Practices

### Before Flattening
1. **Backup Important Data**: Always backup irreplaceable files
2. **Preview First**: Use Preview mode to understand the changes
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure you have write access to the folder
4. **Close Applications**: Close any programs using files in the folder

### During Operation
1. **Don't Interrupt**: Let the process complete to avoid partial moves
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the log for any error messages
3. **Check Statistics**: Verify the numbers make sense for your folder

### After Flattening
1. **Verify Results**: Check that all expected files are present
2. **Review Log**: Look for any errors or warnings
3. **Test Files**: Ensure moved files open correctly
4. **Clean Up**: The original empty folders are removed automatically

## Technical Details

### File Operation Method
- Uses Python's `shutil.move()` for atomic file operations

- Handles long file paths and Unicode characters

### Performance Optimization
- Recursive directory scanning with `pathlib`
- Threaded processing to maintain UI responsiveness
- Memory-efficient processing of large folder structures
- Optimized duplicate detection algorithms

### Security Considerations
- No network access required
- No data transmitted or stored remotely
- Local file operations only
- User-controlled operation with confirmation dialogs
