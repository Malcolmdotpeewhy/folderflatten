# Folder Flattener Pro - Enhanced Requirements
# Modern GUI application with glassmorphic design for intelligent folder organization

# Core dependencies (standard library used primarily)
# The application works with Python standard library only for basic functionality

# Optional enhanced features:
tkinterdnd2>=0.3.0    # Drag and drop functionality
                      # Enables dragging folders directly into the application
                      # Install with: pip install tkinterdnd2

# Development and testing (optional):
pytest>=7.0.0         # For running comprehensive tests
black>=22.0.0         # Automatic code formatting  
mypy>=0.950          # Static type checking

# Performance optimization (optional):
psutil>=5.9.0         # System monitoring and resource usage
                      # For better progress tracking on large operations

# Note: Folder Flattener Pro is designed to work without any external dependencies
# All optional packages enhance the user experience but are not required
# for core functionality. The app gracefully degrades features when packages
# are not available.
